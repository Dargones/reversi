# Reversi Game Analyzer
This repository stores code that can be used to analyze the Reversi (aka. Othello) board game, which is a
perfect information, zero-sum, two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 board. Reversi is a game which can be 
easily abstracted for any square board and the current algorithm solves (i.e. finds the winner of a perfectly-played game)
the 6x6 version of Reversi in 6 hours. A more detailed description 
of the code can be found in [a report](https://github.com/Dargones/reversi/blob/master/Final_Project_Report.pdf)
written for one of the courses I've taken at Bard College.
